# Tunable Directional Emission and Collective Dissipation with Quantum Metasurfaces
Codes to reproduce the figures shown in the article: Tunable directional emission and collective dissipation with quantum metasurfaces.

## Dependences

This package needs the following packages:

```bash
pip install numpy
pip install scipy
pip install matplotlib
pip install tqdm
pip install joblib
```

## Usage
In [`general_functions.py`](https://github.com/Davtax/Tunable-emission-metasurfaces/blob/main/general_functions.py) contains the main functions. These functions are called from the different jupyter notebooks that reproduce the figures of the article (main text and supplemental material). Inside the folder [img](https://github.com/Davtax/Tunable-emission-metasurfaces/img) are located the pictures used in the notebooks to schematically describe the system.
